## ðŸ”¬ Overview

This repository contains implementations, datasets, and results for our **quantum-ready Unit Commitment (UC) framework**.  
We reformulate deterministic and stochastic UC into a **three-block ADMM** with Block 2 cast as a **QUBO** problem.  
These QUBOs are then solved using both brute force and the **Distributed Variational Quantum Eigensolver (DVQE)**.

Our framework supports:
- Three decomposition modes: three-QUBO, micro-QUBO, and batched-QUBO
- Hybrid quantumâ€“classical execution of UC subproblems
- Validation across **small (3 units)**, **medium (20 units)**, and **large (50 units)** UC systems

All numerical experiments, figures, and dispatch tables in the paper can be reproduced here.
